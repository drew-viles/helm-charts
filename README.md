# Helm Charts

A collection of helm charts for things that currently don't exist or that I needed at some point and got bored of writing the manifests out.

## Contributing

* Create a new branch with the version you're working on.
  `git checkout -b SOME_BRANCH`
* Change what you need to within the chart you're working on.
* Run `yamllint` and `helm-docs` on your work to ensure the actions complete.
* Push your changes and the linting/documentation and testing action will run.
* All going well, raise a pull request.

Once the pull request has been accepted, a new release will be automatically created.
