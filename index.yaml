    description: '# Generic End-2-End testing  This setup will deploy a multi-replica
      deployment with a web frontend and a database backend. They are in reality not
      linked and do not have a valid application but the test is to ensure we can
      spin things up using affinity and ant-affinity, volumes and more.  ## Features
      * Affinity/anti-affinity to attempt to evenly split workloads * Multiple replicas
      of nginx and Postgresql * Volume creation and mounting in Postgresql container
      * Configmap mounting for Nginx Index.php for querying the Postgres sts - confirms
      cluster dns works * SQL seeding for populating DB on Post start lifecycle -
      confirms cluster dns works * Public and Private Ingress * PDB to ensure pods
      stay online at all times * Scripts to deploy, delete and test  # Tests ## Ingress
      Testing  This workload will spin up an example deployment with an ingress and
      certificate combo to confirm that ingress is working with TLS.  ## Affinity/Anti-Affinity
      Testing  This workload will spin up an example deployment to test affinity and
      anti-affinity. An Nginx and Postgres workload will be added to the cluster.  The
      Nginx pods should sit on different nodes to one another as should the Postgres
      pods. However, the Nginx pods should share a node with the Postgres and vice
      versa.  Once deployed, confirm that the pods are arranged as such onn each node.  ***
      Node X is just a random node in the EKS cluster, the pods are not assigned to
      the nodes in any sort of order due to affinity settings ***  | **Node A**  |

    description: '# Virt Operator for Kube Virt  KubeVirt technology addresses the
      needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt Kubernetes but
      possess existing Virtual Machine-based workloads that cannot be easily containerized.
      More specifically, the technology provides a unified development platform where
      developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both Application
      Containers as well as Virtual Machines in a common, shared environment.  Benefits
      are broad and significant. Teams with a reliance on existing virtual machine-based
      workloads are empowered to rapidly containerize applications. With virtualized
      workloads placed directly in development workflows, teams can decompose them
      over time while still leveraging remaining virtualized components as is comfortably
      desired. '
